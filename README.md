# Karyab - Job Finding Application

- Modern and User Friendly
- Fully Responsive
- Built with React (Vite) and Tailwind

Features that the app lacks?

- Building BackEnd (Now JSON file fetches from my github repo and you cant add or delete data but the logic is codedðŸ˜…)
- Categories by Job fields and City
- Search by Title
- ~~There is 404 Page but it should be **Without** Navbar and Footer~~ (Fixed)
- âœ… ~~Darkmode~~
- âœ… ~~Fixed-top-navbar~~
- âœ… ~~Hamburger menu on the Phone~~
