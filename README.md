# Karyab Application

Job Finding Front-End

- Modern and User Friendly
- Built with React (Vite) and Tailwind

Features that the app lacks?

- Categories by Job fields and City
- Search by Title
- âœ… ~~Darkmode~~
- âœ… ~~Fixed-top-navbar~~
- âœ… ~~Hamburger menu on the Phone~~
- ~~There is 404 Page but it should be **Without** Navbar and Footer~~ (Fixed)
