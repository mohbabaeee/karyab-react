# Karyab Application

Job Finding Front-End

- Modern and User Friendly
- Built with React (Vite) and Tailwind

features that the app lacks?

- âœ… ~~Darkmode~~ (in 404 page darkmode disables?? (but it can activated manualy))
- âœ… ~~Fixed-top-navbar~~
- better JSON fetching ( Now JSON fetches from my github repo and you cant add or delete dataðŸ˜…)
- Categories by Job fields and City
- Search by Title
- Hamburger menu on the Phone
- There is 404 Page but it should be **Without** Navbar and Footer
